The vasculature has a profound effect on the brain's function and physiology as well as being the origin or reserve mechanism of pathologies. With MRI we have the unique potential to image non-invasively the structure and function of vasculature as well as associated downstream pathologies. 

Vessel imaging sits in the heart of my research interests, with ultra-high field MRI as well as motion correction pushing the effective image resolution to see smaller vessel, and vessel distance mapping as an image post-processing technique to analyze the vasculature with respect to is surrounding anatomy.


The quest to obtain ultra-high resolution vessel images resulted in some of the highest resolution MR images published to date with up to [140 µm isotropic resolution](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71186.sa0). The result show that with MRI it is feasible to image the pial arterial vasculature. Imaging pial arteries is crucial to understand the signal origin of fMRI as they show some of the largest responses to neuronal activity across all vessel types.

Further, the integrity of (small) vessels is intertwined with diseases such as CSVD, ALS, and Alzheimer's. Hence, imaging and assessing them will improve our understanding of the diseases and, potentially, lead to new approaches for diagnostics and therapy.

For vessel assessment, segmenting the vessel of interest is required. While an active field of research, segmenting small vessels from high resolution 3D data is challenging (see our [vessel segmentation challenge](https://doi.org/10.7303/syn47164761)).

* Review on how the (micro)vasculature is impacting ALS disease progression. We discuss markers of how to assess the microvascular integrity with MRI (state of the art and promising new techniques) as well as how vascular supply patterns could play a role as a resistance or resilience mechanism in ALS.
