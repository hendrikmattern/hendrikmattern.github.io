The aim is to investigate the relationship between impaired perivascular drainage and the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in Alzheimer's patients undergoing amyloid-β antibody therapy. A multimodal cohort will be examined for this purpose. MRI-based markers for drainage will be correlated with the blood markers to identify new biomarkers, taking lifestyle into account. These biomarkers have the potential to serve as non-invasive markers for impaired drainage and thus improve the risk stratification of patients.
