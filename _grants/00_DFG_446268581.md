Project was awarded to me as part of the 9th Nachwuchsakademie Medizintechnik (NAMT-2019) “Quantitative MRI as a key modality in life sciences” of the DFG.

Within the project Vessel distance mapping (VDM) was developed, a image post-processing tool to assess the vasculature and its patterns with respect to the surrounding anatomy. VDM is versatile tool and has been applied to study vascular patterns and vascular reserve mechanisms using in vivo and ex vivo MRI as well as microscopy.  You can find more details about VDM (including relevant publications) on [my research page](/research/vessel_distance_mapping/) and in the [final grant report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8169957).
