Welcome to my little space on the internet. I'm Hendrik, an engineer by training, researching in the field of MRI method development. I'm fortunate to have excellent research partners all around the globe (see interactive map below). Together we push MR methods and contribute to the fields of neuroscience and neurology. 


In particular I'm interested in ultra-high resolution imaging, usually at ultra-high field MRI and with motion correction, and imaging as well as quantification of the vasculature. 
Besides this, I have fun with some pet projects, such as using chemical shift artifacts of an oil mask to [prospectively anonymize k-space data](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28460 "link to CHARISMA MRM paper").
