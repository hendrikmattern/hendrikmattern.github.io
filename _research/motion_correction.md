Motion is one of the archenemies of MRI. While the field of motion correction is usually concerned with making non-diagnostic images diagnostic, even compliant volunteers move unintentionally due to breathing and muscle relaxation. For (ultra-)high resolution MRI,  this unintentional motion has an amplitude on the order of the voxel size. Hence, effectively reduced resolution due to motion-induced blurring is the consequence. 

To overcome this inevitable resolution limit motion tracking and subsequent correction with high precision is required. I have worked extensively with [prospective motion correction using an optical, MR-compatible tracking system](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133921), but also have used [fat navigators with retrospective correction](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.27908). While motion is an essential thread to (ultra-)high resolution MRI, it can be addressed with motion correction and we have achieved images with up to 140 µm isotropic resolution in vivo. Note that the optimal motion correction approach depends on the study at hand.
