Starting in the 2025 summer semester, I am responsible for the module Physics I \& II for the bachelor Engineering Science at the OVGU Magdeburg. You can find the material and syllabus [*here*](https://github.com/hendrikmattern/physics "link to Physics I and II material").

Further, I'm a tutor for the *"Basics of Magnetic Resonance"* course every winter semester since 2019. 

From 2018 to 2025, I was a tutor for the *"Physics for Engineers"* course, supervising the lab experiments every summer and teaching physics exercises every winter semester.

Besides teaching on the university-level, I'm part of the
[*Magnetic Resonance System Engineering*](https://www.forschungscampus-stimulate.de/deu/aktuelles/news/neuer-workshop-zum-magnetic-resonance-system-engineering-gestartet.html "link to MRSE press release") 
course offered exclusively to Siemens's high potentials. Within this 9 day interactive course, I'm in charge of the theory lectures and hands-on demos at the 3T Skyra for MRI performance and MR artifacts, respectively.

# Student projects

Over the past years, I have supervised a number of student projects and thesis (see my [CV](/cv/)) and I'm always happy to supervise students with a passion for their project. Just reach out to me to discuss your topic idea. 
Typical topics include, but are not limited to:
* Sequence programming in IDEA or with PulSeq
* Image reconstruction with BART
* Image postprocessing to assess the interdepenceny of vasculature and anatomy
* MR motion correction
