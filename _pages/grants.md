Together with partners, I have been granted funding for the following projects:


## Vascular resistance and resilience in ALS – an ultrahigh-resolution 7T MRI study of the motor cortex
* Funding agency: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)
* Funding period: 01.10.2022-30.09.2024
* Project number: <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/501214112?language=en" target="_blank"> 501214112 </a>


## MD-DARS: MagDeburger DrAinage-Reserve-Score for patient-specific, MRI-based prediction of perivascular drainage in the Alzheimer’s continuum
* Funding agency: Deutsche Alzheimer Gesellschaft (DAG) e.V.
* Funding period: 01.10.2022-30.09.2024

While immunotherapies against the typical Alzheimer's protein β-amyloid (Aβ) hold great potential, they are associated with an increased risk of brain hemorrhage and edema. 
The risks seems to be releated to higher burden of Aβ deposition  along small cerebral vessels. 
The Aβ deposition itself is thought to be a consequence of inadequate perivascular drainage (PVD). 
Hence, if a patient has impaired PVD a higher risk for serious side effects is present. 
Consequently, there is the need to stringently selected and continuously monitored patietns during Aβ immunotherapy. 
To that end, we will acquired, quantify, and relate multimodal PVD-associated MRI markers with in this project. 
The aim is to establish the so-called MagDeburger DrAinage-Reserve-Score to allow for an effective and precise patient-specific quantification of the response and safety of PVD-dependent therapy approaches based on MRI biomarkers.


## Vessel distance mapping: Quantification of subcortical arterial and venous vascular patterns to study their interdependency
* Funding agency: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)
* Funding period: 01.07.2020-30.06.2021
* Project number: <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/446268581?language=en" target="_blank"> 446268581 </a>
* Final grant report: [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8169957](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8169957)

Project was awarded to me as part of the 9th Nachwuchsakademie Medizintechnik (NAMT-2019) “Quantitative MRI as a key modality in life sciences” of the DFG.
