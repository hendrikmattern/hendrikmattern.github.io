Neurofluids is a novel umbrella term referring to all fluid-filled spaces in the brain. This includes the vasculature with arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins as well as perivascular spaces (PVS), interstitial fluid (ISF), and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Neurofluids have a profound effect on the brain's function and physiology as well as being the origin of reserve mechanisms and the driver of waste clearance in the brain. With MRI we have the unique potential to image non-invasively the structure and function of neurofluids as well as associated downstream pathologies. 

The quest to obtain ultra-high resolution vessel images resulted in some of the highest resolution MR images published to date with up to [140 µm isotropic resolution](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71186.sa0). The result show that with MRI it is feasible to image the pial arterial vasculature. Imaging pial arteries is crucial to understand the signal origin of fMRI as they show some of the largest responses to neuronal activity across all vessel types.

Similarly, multi-modal, ultra-high resolution MRI has been used to show that MR-visible PVS are [associated with arteries and not veins in the basal ganglia](https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678X241260629).

Further, the integrity of (small) vessels and PVS is intertwined with diseases such as CSVD, ALS, and Alzheimer's. Hence, imaging and assessing, e.g. with vessel distance mapping, them will improve our understanding of the diseases and, potentially, lead to new approaches for diagnostics and therapy.
