#WORK IN PROGRESS

Welcome to my little page. I'm Hendrik, an engineer by training, working in the field of MR resarch, leveraging physics and computer science to contribute to the fields of neuroscience and neurology. 

On this page you can find my research interests, funding information, links to publications and CV, as well as my teaching and student project record. Occasionally, I'll add blog posts.
