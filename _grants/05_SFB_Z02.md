The central project Z02 provides mesoscopic imaging of the human brain structure, function and neurofluids to all researchers within the <a href="https://sfb1436.de/" target="_blank"> Collaborative Research Centres (CRC) 1436 </a>.


Beyond collaborations within the CRC1436, I am in charge of WP2 *"Mesoscopic imaging and assessment of neurofluids"* in Z02.
The aim of WP2 is to provide imaging and post-processing of neurofluids, i.e. vessels, perivascular spaces (PVS), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and interstitial fluid (ISF). Neurofluids are closely related to vascular health and brain clearance, all active fields of research w.r.t. aging, pathology and cognition.  By leveraging our 7T Connectome and [VDM](/research/vessel_distance_mapping) framework, WP2 provides: (i) High-resolution IVIM to study perfusion and ISF volume in vivo, (ii) 
optimise structural neurofluid imaging of arteries, veins, and PVS (iii) improve usability of [VDM](/research/vessel_distance_mapping) toolbox and provide user support for VDM analysis.
