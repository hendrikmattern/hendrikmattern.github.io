While immunotherapies against the typical Alzheimer's protein β-amyloid (Aβ) hold great potential, they are associated with an increased risk of brain hemorrhage and edema. 
The risks seems to be releated to higher burden of Aβ deposition  along small cerebral vessels. 
The Aβ deposition itself is thought to be a consequence of inadequate perivascular drainage (PVD). 
Hence, if a patient has impaired PVD a higher risk for serious side effects is present. 
Consequently, there is the need to stringently selected and continuously monitored patietns during Aβ immunotherapy. 
To that end, we will acquired, quantify, and relate multimodal PVD-associated MRI markers with in this project. 
The aim is to establish the so-called MagDeburger DrAinage-Reserve-Score to allow for an effective and precise patient-specific quantification of the response and safety of PVD-dependent therapy approaches based on MRI biomarkers.
